# SortingRace

This is a race between five different sorting algorithms. 
Each time they were tested, an array of size n was created and populated with random integers. 
For each n, 100 tests were conducted and an average time was taken to try to find the most accurate time. 

Datasets Tested: 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 500,000 1,000,000
Algorithms Used: Radix sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort
